Coda Wing Man 
=============

**Wing Man** displays a floating window that contains the list of files currently open in the foremost [Coda](http://panic.com/coda) window. Click on a file name to switch to the corresponding tab in Coda. This can be helpful when working with lots of files that would otherwise be squished in the tab bar.

Available as a **Coda plug-in** or a **standalone app**.

To **install** the plug-in, copy it into your **~/Library/Application Support/Coda/Plug-ins/** directory and re-launch Coda.

Features
--------
* Optionally show file path
* Optionally sort by file path
* Abridge file path when file is inside the current site directory (plug-in only)
* Choose a custom font/color for the list
* Optionally always keep window visible

Known Limitation
-----------------
The list cannot automatically update when a tab is opened or closed in Coda. Please use the refresh button, the "Refresh Tab List" menu item and the CMD+OPT+0 key command to update the list. You can also choose to auto-refresh the list when an item is selected.

Build Instructions
------------------
Open **Wing Man.xcodeproj** in Xcode.

Make sure **Debug** is checked under **Active Configuration** in the drop down menu on the left side of the toolbar.

Select either **Wing Man** or **Wing Man.codaplugin** under **Active Target** from the same menu (Wing Man Updater is built automatically as a dependency for Wing Man.codaplugin).

Click the build button on the toolbar.

Control+Click the bundle you just built in the **Products** group in the side bar and choose **Reveal in Finder**.

If you built the app, you can move it into your Applications folder. If you built the plug-in, copy it into your **~/Library/Application Support/Coda/Plug-ins/** directory and re-launch Coda.

FAQ
---

### Base SDK Missing ###

Wing Man has only been tested on Snow Leopard. If you are trying to build it on a machine running Snow Leopard and you get this error, make sure you have the latest version of Xcode installed.

If you're feeling brave and want to try compiling it on Leopard:

Choose **Project** > **Edit Project Settings** 

Select **Mac OS X 10.5** from the list for the **Base SDK** option on the **Build** tab.

### Error opening key file ###

Make sure **Debug** is checked under **Active Configuration** in the drop down menu on the left side of the toolbar. The Release configuration runs a script that signs the bundle for [Sparkle](http://sparkle.andymatuschak.org) and this will fail unless you edit the Run Script build action for Wing Man and Wing Man.codaplugin and provide paths to your own Sparkle keys.
